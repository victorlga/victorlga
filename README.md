<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Victor Assis</h1>

I'm pursuing a Computer Engineering undergraduate degree at [Insper - Instituto de Ensino e Pesquisa](https://www.insper.edu.br/). I have a deep curiosity about the intersection of computing and biology and am excited about the potential of technology to address complex problems in these fields.

### Current Role
I'm a part-time remote Research Intern at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine's THINK Lab. I'm developing bioinformatics tools under the guidance of Lucas Bulgarelli and Rodrigo Deliberato, MD, PhD.

### Technical Skills
**Programming Languages:** I have a solid foundation in Python and C/C++, which I continuously strive to improve and expand upon.

**Areas of Interest:** I'm particularly drawn to high-performance computing, machine learning, and bioinformatics.

**Current Studies:** I am focused on learning deep learning architectures for biological contexts and starting to learn CUDA.
